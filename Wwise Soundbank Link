As the Wwise soundbank is too large, the file has been excluded from the repository.

The init.bnk and Soundbank1.bnk must be copied into the correct folder for testing or building.

It is stored here:

For building:
The init.bnk and Soundbank1.bnk in the Android folder must be copied into:
madeByOctopodes\SpaceShark\Assets\StreamingAssets\Audio\GeneratedSoundBanks\Android\

For testing, the android windows and mac init.bnk and Soundbank1.bnk files must be copied into their respective folders in this directory:
